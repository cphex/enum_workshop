# Enum Workshop

A workshop where we reimplement common functions found in the Elixir Enum module.

You can find a description about a given module by typing `h Enum.count` in iex.

## Installation

Create a fork of the repo and push your solution to your fork so we can compare solutions at the end of the workshop.
